# the BACKEND

</div>

</br>

## Objective

Develop a robust backend application that leverages one or more chosen 3rd party APIs, your own APIs, or a combination, while incorporating a database to enhance functionality.

<br>

## Build steps:

1. Initialize Backend Express App: Set up a new Express application for your backend. Ensure it's structured and organized for scalability.

2. Choose a Database: Decide whether you want to use MySQL or MongoDB for your database. Implement a connection to the chosen database.

3. Create CRUD Operations: Develop routes in your Express app that cover all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This ensures a comprehensive functionality for your backend.

4. Build Controllers and Models: Implement controllers and models to handle the business logic and data structure of your application. Keep your code modular and maintainable.

5. Testing with Postman/Bruno: Thoroughly test your backend routes using tools like Postman or Bruno. Ensure that your API endpoints function as expected and handle different scenarios.

6. API Documentation with Swagger UI: Generate clear and concise API documentation using Swagger UI. This documentation should provide detailed information on how to interact with your backend API. (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33317300/2sA2xcbac5)

7. Fine-tune and Optimize: Optimize your code for performance and handle edge cases effectively. Ensure that error handling is robust and provides meaningful responses.

> _Presentation Preparation:_
>
> _Prepare a concise and engaging presentation to showcase your backend project to the class. Aim for a 5-minute presentation. Highlight key features, challenges faced, and any unique aspects of your project._

8. Presentation Date: Plan to present your backend project to the class on the (TBD) of Feb. Be ready to share insights into your design decisions, challenges faced, and the overall functionality of your application.

<br>

By following these steps, you'll create a well-structured, fully functional backend application that effectively integrates 3rd party APIs and a database.

```

</br>

â–ª How does the back end process this data?

```
The backend pulls data from the API which then gets routed through to the database so all information is stored.
```

</br>

â–ª How can the user interact with this data?

```
